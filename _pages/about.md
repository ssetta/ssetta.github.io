I am a biological oceanographer, focused on phytoplankton ecology across ocean regions. I'm interested in communicating both my research and cutting edge science to the non-specialists.

I'm interested in studying how changes in environment impact phytoplankton, microscopic photosynthesizers at the base of the food web. I'm especially intersted in how changes in phytoplankton can impact local communities, like that of harmful algal blooms, when phytoplankton proliferate with high nutrients or release toxic substances.

I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href='https://www.pmel.noaa.gov/ocean-molecular-ecology/'>Ocean Molecuar Ecology Lab</a> at the NOAA Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory and <a href='https://cicoes.uw.edu/'>The University of Washington</a>. My current research focuses on the distribution and survival of phytoplankton across nutrient, temperature and ocean acidification gradients.

**My Story**

My interest in oceans started at a young age when I was able to take a class in aquatic biology in high school. While pursuing my undergraduate degree, I worked with coral reef evolution, with seagrass ecosystems, and took a class on phytoplankton ecology. After graduating, I took a few years before starting my graduate degree to figure out exactly what field of marine biology I wanted to study. I worked with algal biofuels for a few months through Texas A&M Agrilife, and in salt marsh biogeochemistry at Lousiana Universities Marine Consortium (LUMCON). During my time in Louisiana, I decided to pursue a master’s in a research lab focused on phytoplankton, something I became interested in during my undergrad. For my master’s, I researched the effects of oil spills on phytoplankton communities and decided to further my studies and pursue a Ph.D. in oceanography to understand how phytoplankton are influenced by changing ocean systems.
