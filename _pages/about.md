I am a biological oceanographer, focused on phytoplankton ecology across ocean regions. I'm interested in communicating both my research and cutting edge science to the general public. 

My Story
======

My interest in ocean ecosystems started at a young age growing up in Austin, TX. I was able to take a class in aquatic biology in high school but didn't know that I wanted to focus on Marine Science (or Biology) until I took a class during my undergraduate at University of Texas at Austin. While pursuing my degree, I worked in the Matz Lab with coral reef evolution, Dunton Lab with seagrass ecosystems, and took a class on phytoplankton ecology with Dr. Deana Erdner. After graduating, I took a few years before starting my graduate degree to figure out exactly what field of marine biology I wanted to study. I worked with algal biofuels for a few months through Texas A&M Agrilife, and in salt marsh biogeochemistry at Lousiana Universities Marine Consortium (LUMCON) in the Roberts Biogeochemistry Lab. During my time in Louisiana, I decided to pursue a master’s in a research lab focused on phytoplankton, something I became interested in during my time at UT Austin. For my master’s, I researched the effects of oil spills on phytoplankton communities in the Quigg Phytoplankton Dynamics Lab at Texas A&M. While finishing my master’s, I decided to further my studies and pursue a Ph.D. in oceanography to understand how phytoplankton are influenced by ocean systems.

I'm currently a Ph.D. student in the <a href https://web.uri.edu/rynearson-lab/>Rynearson Lab<a/> at the <a href https://web.uri.edu/gso/>Graduate School of Oceanography<a/> at the University of Rhode Island. My current research focuses on the distribution and survival of phytoplankton across nutrient gradients. While at GSO, I started participating in outreach to communicate ocean science to grade schools in the area through Narragansett Bay Classroom and writing for <a href https://oceanbites.org/>Oceanbites.org<a/>, a blog focused on communicating recently published science research to the general public.
