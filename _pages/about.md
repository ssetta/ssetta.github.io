I am a biological oceanographer, focused on phytoplankton ecology across ocean regions. I'm interested in communicating both my research and cutting edge science to the general public. 

My Story
======
My interest in ocean ecosystems started when I was young, growing up in Austin, TX. I was able to take a class in aquatic biology in highschool, but didn't know I wanted to focus on Marine Science (or Biology) until I took a class during my undergraduate at University of Texas at Austin. While pursuing my undergraduate degree I worked in the Matz Lab with the evolution of coral reefs, Dunton Lab with seagrass, and took a class on phytoplankton ecology with Dr.Deana Erdner. After finishing I took a few years before starting my graduate degree to figure out exactly what field of marine biology I wanted to study. I worked with algal biofuels for a few months through Texas A&M Agrilife, and in salt marsh biogeochemistry at Lousiana Universities Marine Consortium (LUMCON) in the Roberts Biogeochemistry Lab. During my time in Louisiana, I decided to pursue a Master's in a research lab focused on phytoplankton, something I became intereseted in during my undergraduate degree. For my masters I researched the effects of oil spills on phytoplankton communities in the Quigg Phytoplankton Dynamics Lab at Texas A&M. While finishing my Masters I decided to further my studies and pursue a Ph.D. in oceanography to understand how phytoplankton are influenced by ocean systems.

I'm currently a Ph.D. student in the (Rynearson Lab)[https://web.uri.edu/rynearson-lab/] at the Graduate School of Oceanography (GSO)[https://web.uri.edu/gso/] at the University of Rhode Island. My current research focuses on the distribution and survival of phytoplankton across nutrient gradients. While at GSO I started participating in outreach to communicate ocean science to grade schools in the area through Narragansett Bay Classroom and writing for (Oceanbites.org)[https://oceanbites.org/] a blog focused on communicating recently published science research to the general public.
